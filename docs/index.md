## What is Snitch?

Snitch is a fullstack application for managing privileged access to AWS accounts. Admins define Cedar policies that authorize IAM Identity Center (IDC) users or groups to assume specific Permission Sets on AWS accounts. End-users request temporary, time-boxed access through a self-service UI; access is granted automatically by a Step Functions workflow and revoked when the requested duration expires.

## Core Features

| Feature | Description |
|---|---|
| **Privileged Policies** | Admins create Cedar policies that map IDC principals to AWS accounts and permission sets |
| **JIT Access Requests** | Users request temporary access; a Step Functions workflow assigns and revokes the permission set |
| **Approval Gate** | Policies can require approval before access is granted; approvers are configured per account |
| **Elevated Access** | Admins view all active requests, revoke access early, and inspect the CloudTrail audit trail |
| **Notifications** | Slack and Amazon SNS alerts for access requested, finished, and approval-required events, each toggled in Settings |
| **AVP Authorization** | All access decisions are evaluated by AWS Verified Permissions (Cedar), not application logic |
| **CloudTrail Audit** | Every activated session is queryable through CloudWatch Logs via a configurable log group ([setup]({% link pages/cloudtrail-setup.md %})) |
| **Live Status Updates** | A DynamoDB stream republishes every request status transition over an AppSync subscription, so admin and auditor tables update without polling |

## Technology Stack
