## What It Does

Any authenticated user can request **temporary, time-boxed access** to an AWS account through the self-service **Request Access** page. Snitch grants the permission set automatically, keeps it active for the requested duration, then revokes it — no manual clean-up, no standing access.

---

## Requesting Access

The Request Access form only offers what the user is actually allowed to request. Based on their [Privileged Policies]({% link pages/privileged-policies.md %}), Snitch shows:

- The **accounts** they may access.
- The **permission sets** available on each account.
- The **maximum duration** they may request.

The user picks an account, a permission set, and how long they need access (by choosing when it should end), optionally adds a justification, and submits.

If the matching policy requires approval, the form warns the user up front, and the request waits for an approver before any access is granted.

## What Happens After Submitting

Once submitted, the request runs through an automated workflow:

1. If approval is required, it waits for an approver to act (or times out after 24 hours).
2. If a future start time was chosen, it waits until then.
3. The permission set is assigned to the user on the target account — access is now **active**.
4. When the duration elapses, the permission set is removed automatically.

An admin can also end an active session early from the [Elevated Access]({% link pages/elevated-access.md %}) page.

## Request Statuses

Every request shows its current status:

| Status | Meaning |
|---|---|
| **Pending** | No approval needed; waiting for the permission set to be assigned |
| **Pending approval** | Waiting for an approver to act |
| **Scheduled** | Approved, waiting for a future start time |
| **Active** | Access is granted right now |
| **Expired** | The duration elapsed (or an approval timed out) and access was removed |
| **Revoked** | An admin ended the session early |
| **Rejected** | An approver rejected the request |
| **Failed** | Something went wrong in the workflow |

## Request History

Each user sees their own request history on the Request Access page, with the status, account, permission set, and duration of every request they've made.
