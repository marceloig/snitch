## What It Does

The **Settings** page (admin-only) is where administrators configure application-level options, grouped into three cards:

- **CloudTrail Audit Logs** — the CloudWatch log group that powers the audit trail.
- **Slack Integration** — the Slack app credentials used for approval messages and notifications.
- **Access-Request Notifications** — the per-channel toggles for Slack and email alerts.

---

## CloudTrail Audit Logs

To enable the audit trail on the [Elevated Access]({% link pages/elevated-access.md %}) and [Session Activity]({% link pages/session-activity.md %}) pages:

1. Make sure CloudTrail is delivering events to a CloudWatch Logs log group **in the same AWS account and Region as Snitch** — follow [CloudTrail Setup]({% link pages/cloudtrail-setup.md %}), which covers the delegated-administrator registration and the AWS CLI commands this requires.
2. Open **Settings** in Snitch.
3. Enter the log group name (e.g., `CloudTrail/snitch-audit`) and save.

Once configured, Snitch queries that log group for each session's activity. If it's left blank, the audit trail is simply empty.

Snitch reads the log group from its own account and Region. A log group in the Organizations management account, or in another Region, is unreachable and the audit trail stays empty.

## Notifications

Snitch can notify a team channel or mailing list about the access-request lifecycle through two independent channels — **Slack** and **email (Amazon SNS)**. Every notification is best-effort: if delivery fails, it never blocks or breaks the underlying access request.

### What gets notified

| Event | When it fires | Channels |
|---|---|---|
| **Access requested** | A user submits a request | Slack, email |
| **Access finished** | A granted session ends (expired or revoked) | Slack, email |
| **Approval required** | A request is waiting for an approver | Slack (interactive buttons), email (link to the app) |

Each channel is controlled by its own toggle, so you can, for example, send approval alerts by email while sending requested/finished updates to Slack.

### Slack

To use Slack notifications, enter the Slack app credentials (bot token, channel, and signing secret) in the **Slack Integration** card, then enable the Slack notifications toggle.

- **Requested / finished** messages are informational.
- **Approval required** messages include **Approve** / **Reject** buttons so approvers can act directly from Slack. The clicker's identity is verified and authorized before anything happens, so only real approvers can act.

### Email (Amazon SNS)

Email notifications are delivered through an app-managed Amazon SNS topic. To receive them:

1. Deploy the backend so the topic exists.
2. In **Settings**, copy the read-only **SNS Topic ARN**.
3. In the AWS console, create a subscription on that topic (protocol **Email** or **SMS**) for your endpoint, and confirm it from the confirmation message.
4. Enable the relevant SNS toggle(s) in Settings.

Email subject lines include the account label, for example `AWS access approval required - Production (111111111111)`.

{: .note }
Approval **emails** deliberately don't carry one-click approve/reject buttons: an email recipient can't be securely identified, so the message instead links to the in-app Approve Requests page, where the approver signs in and acts with full authorization. Slack approvals stay interactive because the Slack click is verified and authorized.
